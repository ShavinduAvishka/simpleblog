	<p>
		We recommend using Static Generation (with and without data) whenever<br>
		possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes <br>
		it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.<br><br>

		You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including: Marketing pages,<br>Blog posts, E-commerce product listings, Help and documentation.<br><br>

		You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page ahead of a user's request?" <br>If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.<br>

		On the other hand, Static Generation is not a good idea if you cannot pre-render<br> a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, <br>
		and the page content changes on every request.<br><br>

		In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering.</strong> <br>It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date.<br> Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.<br><br>
